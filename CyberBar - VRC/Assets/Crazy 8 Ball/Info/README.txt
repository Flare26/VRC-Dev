Crazy 8 Ball Prefab
----------------------

A Magic 8 Ball prefab designed to give a random answer to any question you ask it!
To setup: Just drag the "Crazy 8 Ball Full" prefab anywhere in your scene, and in-game just grab the
Crazy 8 Ball, ask it a yes or no question, shake it, and it will give you an answer!
Answers are synced with all players, so everyone will see the same response.
Note: The world must have some form of lighting for the shader on the ball to work with the most desirble look.
Warning: A desync bug was found but was resolved when the value for the delay on line 83 in the EightBallFortuneScript was increased, though this increases sync delay so increase with caution.

----------------------
Editing Responses
You can edit the responses that the ball outputs easily through the 8BallAns

The texture has outlines showing the responses, just paint over the pre-existing responses 
and add your own. They can be words symbols etc just as long as they are within the outlines it will display.
