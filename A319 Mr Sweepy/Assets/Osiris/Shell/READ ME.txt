For easiest use. 
Drag and drop the prefab into your scene with your model and add a rigidbody to your hips. 
Have all the constraints turned on and gravity turned off. 
Then simply drag and drop your hips into the empty slot on the fixed joint. 
Obviously, there's other ways too but that's the easiest. 
Enjoy!
